Summary: Apple's 'Liquid Glass' design is facing criticism, but I think it's actually a strong signal for where Apple are heading. Liquid Glass may not make total sense on a smartphone, and that's because it's going to be Apple's design language for the AR (Augmented Reality) era.


Apple's 'Liquid Glass' design is facing criticism, but I think it's actually a strong signal for where Apple are heading. Liquid Glass may not make total sense on a smartphone, and that's because it's going to be Apple's design language for the AR (Augmented Reality) era.

Apple realise that the next paradigm shift in tech is going to be AR . They are shepherding users into this new paradigm with Liquid Glass, the same way they shepherded users to the iPhone paradigm with skeuomorphic design.

Liquid Glass makes total sense if you imagine it floating in 3D space in front on you. This is where we're heading (once we get the hardware size down to a pair of glasses), and Apple's designers are making the coming shift in tech feel like second nature before it's even arrived.
